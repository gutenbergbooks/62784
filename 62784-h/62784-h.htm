<hr class="tiny" />

<p>In the evolution of any life, whether it be that
of an individual or of that corporate moral union
we know as society, there are times when it seems
fitting and proper to pause from the whirl of incessant
activities, turn aside from accustomed line
of thought, and let the mind run sweetly and lovingly
over a treasured past.</p>

<p>And today our beloved country, in the fulness
of her achievement, with the memories of one
hundred and forty-seven years, one hundred and
forty-seven golden years, lived only that her children
might grow, as from eternity the Creator had destined
them to grow, in the full security of rights
that are inalienable.</p>

<p>Today our beloved country turns to us children
of a later generation and pleads that we follow
this generous impulse of nature, and tarry for the
moment, while she lives over again the thoughts
and emotions and heroic sacrifices that gave her
birth.</p>

<p>They were not new thoughts or unknown emotions.
As John Quincy Adams so well remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
in his scholarly discourse on the Jubilee of the
Constitution: &#8220;The Declaration of Independence
and the Constitution of the United States are parts
of one constant whole, founded upon one and the
same theory of government, then new not as a
theory, for it had been working itself into the mind
of man for many ages, but it had never before been
adopted by a great nation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moses, as narrated in Deuteronomy, had charged
the judges in Israel: &#8220;There shall be no difference
of persons; you shall hear the little as well as the
great; neither shall you respect any man&#8217;s person,
because it is the judgment of God.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aristotle had taught that, &#8220;the State is not
merely an institution for repressing vice, but a
necessary formation for the full development of
humanity.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the Magna Charter the germ of true liberty and
equality is seen in the pledges of the king to his
people: &#8220;We will not set forth against any freeman,
nor send against him, unless by the lawful judgment
of his peers and by the law of the land; to no one
will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay right
or justice.&#8221;</p>

<p>The medi√¶val councils, the military orders, the
guilds, followed centuries after by the contract of
the Pilgrim Fathers made in the cabin of the &#8220;Mayflower&#8221;
in which they &#8220;covenanted and combined
themselves into a civil body politic for their
better order and preservation,&#8221; as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
charters of the Providence Plantations, of Virginia,
and of Maryland, had accustomed the people to
joint action of mutual compact and deliberate agreement
in defense of liberty and justice which, after
all, is the mother of democracy.</p>

<p>While the schoolmen, with scarcely an exception,
as Sidwick tells us, taught that, &#8220;governments
derive their just powers from the consent of
the governed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every constitution,&#8221; says Nicholas of Cusa,
three and a half centuries before the Declaration of
Independence, &#8220;is rooted in natural law and cannot
be valid if it contradicts it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since all are free by nature,&#8221; he continues, &#8220;all
government, whether by written law or a prince,
is based solely on the agreement and consent of the
subject. For if by nature men are equally powerful
and free, true and ordered power in the hands
of one can be established only by the election and
consent of the others, just as law also is established
by consent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is clear, therefore,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;that the binding
validity of all constitutions is based on tacit
and expressed agreement and consent.&#8221;</p>

<p>And although Elizabeth had asserted in 1585 that
&#8220;kings and princes sovereign owe their homage
and service only to Almighty God,&#8221; and James
defended the Divine Right of Kings, and the University
of Cambridge, in its address to Charles II,
had declared that they believed and maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
that &#8220;our kings derive not their title from the
people but from God,&#8221; &#8220;Defenders of Liberty&#8221;
were not wanting, Bellarmine declaring boldly, as
Sir Robert Filmer tells us, that &#8220;secular or civil
power is instituted by men; it is in the people unless
they bestow it on a prince. This power is immediately
in the whole multitude as in the subject
of it. For this power is in the Divine Law, but the
Divine Law hath given this power to no particular
men; if the positive law be taken away, there is
left no reason why amongst a multitude (who are
equal) one rather than another should bear rule over
the rest. Power is given by the multitude to one
man or to more by the same law of nature; for the
commonwealth cannot exercise this power, therefore
it is bound to bestow it upon some one man or
some few. It depends upon the consent of the
multitude to ordain over themselves a king or consul
or other magistrates. And if there be a lawful
cause, the multitude may change the kingdom
into an aristocracy or democracy.&#8221;</p>

<p>These thoughts and emotions, expressed and re-expressed
by the writers, philosophers and political
leaders of their day, had seeped down through the
ages unactuated, mere themes for academic speculation,
until they filtered into the minds and souls
of those simple, yet truly great men, who, in signing
the Declaration of Independence, gave birth to the
nation we so rightfully cherish and so lovingly
serve.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>In a letter to his friend Henry Lee, dated May 8,
1825, Jefferson, as if in confirmation of what we
have just held, notes that the object of the Declaration
of Independence was &#8220;not to find out new
principles, or new arguments, never before thought
of, not merely to say things which had never before
been said; but to place before mankind the common
sense of the subject in terms so plain and firm
as to command their assent and to justify ourselves
in the independent stand we are compelled to take.
Neither aiming at originality of principle or sentiment,
nor yet copied from any particular or previous
writing, it was intended to be an expression of the
<i>American mind</i>, and to give to that expression the
proper tone and spirit called for by the occasion.
All its authority rests then on the harmonizing
sentiments of the day, whether expressed in conversation,
in letters, printed essays, or in the elementary
books of public right, as Aristotle, Cicero,
Locke, Sidney, etc.&#8221;</p>

<p>What, then, was this American mind, that, amid
problems vexed and theories varied, had sifted the
wisdom and folly of the past, discerning the true
from the false, the good from the evil, and &#8220;of
which,&#8221; Jefferson was pleased to say, &#8220;the Declaration
of Independence was intended to be an
expression?&#8221; And what, again, was &#8220;the proper
tone and spirit called for by the occasion&#8221; that the
Declaration of Independence was to give to this
expression of the American mind?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>If we look more closely at the type of men whose
united action founded our nation the answer to
this question will not be far to seek. They, like
many of us here today, were either immigrants or
the immediate descendants of immigrants. They
differed in origin, in education, in race, and in
creed. They had the traditions, the affections, the
prejudices of their times and of their peoples. Yet
in common they had left home and country, led on
by a vision or an ideal that made a fitting basis
for the union that was to come. They would
break away from an effete civilization; they would
start life anew, freed from the tyranny of unjust
laws; they would enjoy liberty to worship their
God according to the dictates of their own conscience;
they would exercise, without unwarranted
interference, their natural and inalienable right to the
pursuit of happiness.</p>

<p>Crossing, as they did, the same unknown seas,
buffeted by the same winds and waves, coming to
the same uncultivated, though not inhospitable
shores, their difficulties, their interests, their common
foe, drew them together in mutual helpfulness,
in united enterprise, and in common defense.</p>

<p>Thus they came to know one another; thus they
learned to bear with one another; thus they grew to
love one another; and understanding, and tolerance,
and brotherly love developed the American
mind. So that, when the occasion arose, in proper
tone and spirit, it expressed itself in the immortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Declaration of Independence that solved the speculative
problems of the past, secured full enjoyment
of liberty for its people, and gave hope and inspiration
to all mankind and for all time.</p>

<p>And shall we mar the beauty of her gift? Shall
we, forgetting our common interests, our common
enterprises, our common foes, destroy the unity of
purpose and of action that is essential for individual
and national prosperity? Shall we, by misunderstanding,
by intolerance and hatred, sully the luster
of our heritage, breaking the bondage of brotherhood?</p>

<p>Ours is a most responsible trust. We must
hand it down to posterity sacred and intact. Capital
must make truce with labor; labor must make
pact with capital; each must measure even in the
scales of justice. The rights&mdash;inalienable rights&mdash;of
man to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,
must not be infringed. The rights&mdash;natural and
civic rights&mdash;of property must not be denied.
Class prejudices, racial pride, assumed superiority,
must be dislodged from the minds of men, that
justice may function and equality and the dignity
of human nature be sustained.</p>

<p>The home must be safeguarded, and its sanctity
preserved, that our children be protected and grow&mdash;as
nature destined them to grow&mdash;in wisdom and
grace before God and man.</p>

<p>The school&mdash;the private and the public school&mdash;free
as speech and the press are free&mdash;must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
encouraged that our citizens may understand the
Constitution and our laws, and in the full development
of their intellectual faculties realize the
burdens as well as the privileges of representative
government.</p>

<p>The church, the House of God, must have its
place of respect, that our children may continue
moral and grow in reverence for authority and for
the divine and human law.</p>

<p>As Hamilton wrote to Washington, on the occasion
of his farewell address: &#8220;In all those dispositions
which promote political happiness, religion
and morality are essential props.&#8221;</p>

<p>This, I take it, is the message our beloved country
would send to us today. That we be men of <i>American
mind</i>, the mind that expressed itself in the
Declaration of Independence, the mind that was
born of understanding, tolerance, and brotherly
love, the mind that didn&#8217;t hesitate to say, in the
closing words of the great document that gave to
us our nation, &#8220;For the support of this declaration,
with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine
Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our
lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.&#8221;</p>

60 pp.) Not until November 22, 1864, was Mr. Alger asked by the City to furnish a
copy for publication. He granted the request, and the first official edition (J. E. Farwell

71 pp.) It is &#8220;the first draft of the author&#8217;s address, turned into larger, legible type,
for the sole purpose of rendering easier its public delivery.&#8221; It was done by &#8220;the liberality
of the City Authorities,&#8221; and is, typographically, the handsomest of these orations. This
resulted in the large-paper 75-page edition, printed from the same type as the 71-page
edition, but modified by the author. It is printed &#8220;by order of the Common Council.&#8221;
The regular edition is in 60 pp., octavo size.</p></div>
